## About the Prototype
Originally I had quite of fun playing my game while making it, but when i came back to it after a while i'll say that it becomes boring real fast!

Some folks in the Haxe Discord server said that the game feels slow, and... that's completely true lol.

The reason why the game feels slow is because the prices of items are ridiculously overpriced! And well, that's because they were changed on the last minute right before publishing it, the reason why I changed them was only because I wanted the game to take longer than 5 rounds for the player to collect them all.

Later on I've noticed that these items were the core fun feature of this game, but it was already too late to make edits since the contest rules said to not edit the game after publishing it.

So my lesson of this project is that I should test my stuff before releasing them to the public.

On a positive note, for my first *public* game, I'm really proud of the whole coding and art style side of this game, specifically the sprite of the main protagonist, they're *[sic]* so cute ong. And so about them! I'm definitely going to use them in my other projects, or maybe this when I will have my motivation back to finish what I fully wanted from this game.

Though if I do finish this game, don't expect anything big!
